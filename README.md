## Hardware

There are several different kits that may be used in the exercises for this class.

To do exercises in all chapters (except the final project in chapter 6) **one** of the following kits is required:

- CY8CPROTO-062-4343W (PSoC™ 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit)
- CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 (PSoC™ 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit)
- CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 (PSoC™ 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit)

To do the final project, you must have the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 kit plus **one** of the following shield boards:

- CY8CKIT-028-SENSE (Shield Board containing sensors, microphones and an OLED display)
- CY8CKIT-028-TFT (Shield Board containing sensors, a microphone and a TFT display)

An ammeter is required if you want to measure current consumption for the low-power exercises in chapter 5:

- Ammeter (for low power chapter exercises)
